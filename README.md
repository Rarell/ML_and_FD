This repository contains the code used in a Evaluation of Flash Drought Identification with Machine Learning Techniques project. The published research paper this project can be found at [here for Part 1](https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-24-0068.1) and [here for Part 2](https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-24-0068.1). The large datasets for training the ML models could not be fit here and are available upon request. The Evaluation of Flash Drought Identification with Machine Learning Techniques project was the main topic for the PhD dissertation written code's author and first name author of the publications (Stuart Edris). The corresponding dissertation for this project can be found [here](https://hdl.handle.net/11244/340537).

The purpose of this project was to examine the ability of various machine learning techniques (random forests, support vector machines, ada boosting, and neural networks) to directly represent flash drought events, according to different flash drought identification methods. The project was performed at the national level, using the North American Regional Analysis to train the models, and at the global level using ERA5. 

This repository contains the code used to conduct the machine learning experiments, the analysis, and the code used to make the original figures. This repository also contains the original figures used within the analysis, in the publications, and in the dissertation.
