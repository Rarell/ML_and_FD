This repository contains the code and some of the data used in a Evaluation of Flash Drought Identification with Machine Learning Techniques project. The published research paper this project can be found at [link](https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-24-0068.1) and [link](https://doi.org/10.1175/AIES-D-24-0068.1). The large datasets for training the ML models could not be fit here and are available upon request. The Evaluation of Flash Drought Identification with Machine Learning Techniques project was the main topic for the PhD dissertation written code's author and first name author of the publications (Stuart Edris).
